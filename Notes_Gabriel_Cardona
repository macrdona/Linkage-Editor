Variables:
- load_point:
    Based on the description from the pseudo code "Get address from operating system",
    I think it means the address where we want to load our program. For now, I will assumethat this address is 0, thus:
        - int load_point = 0;
        - load_point (This variable represents 'CSADDR' in the pseudocode found in the LinkersAndLoaders pdf, page 21-22)

- decimal_load_point:
    Is the decimal representation of load_point which we need for other calculations. 

- nameBeginIndex, nameEndIndex, addressBeginIndex , addressEndIndex 
    The values in these variables specify what position to start looking for the symbol name and address in the 'D record'

- recordD_length
    Is the number of character in the D record, without counting the 'D' character

Methods:
- AddSymbol:
    Adds new symbols to the external symbol table

- SymbolExists
    Checks if symbol already exists in the table

- AddToTable 
    Calls the functions AddSymbol and SymbolExists, to prevent repeating code multiple 

Other details:
The comment "//Column 2 to 7 has the name of the program", refers to 
the specification on the 'Object File Format (SCOFF)' document. It states that, for example, between colunmn 2-7 the Name of external symbol defined in this object file. So I am grabbing the name of the external symbol from that postion in the record. 

The comment "//calculating new address based on load_point", it refers to 
(CSADDR + indicated address) in the pseudocode found in the LinkersAndLoaders pdf, page 21-22

-Expected arguments increased from three to four. We are no expecting an extra argument that should be the address to which the program will be relocated to. 


-Changes to load_point and decimal_load_point variables.
When we read the first argument (assuming that the address will be give in hex), we store the relocation address into variable load_point. We convert the address into decimal and store it in decimal_load_point.

-Added function to add nessesary symbols (like zeros) to hex values

-Created function to check that address does not exceed SIC/XE memory limit. The function is called "checkMemory", parameter is a number of type long.

-Changed all variables storing address type from int to long. This is because if a big enough hexadecimal address was given, then the conversion from hex to int would be incorrect.

-Fix the addresses, their offsets, and calculated new program length after linking all the files

-Fix bugs with the addresses

-Added functionality to create file and write the object code to the new file

-Added functionality to free external symbol table
