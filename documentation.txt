About the Linkage Editor
A Linker (or Linkage Editor) is defined as a computer system program that takes object modules,
load modules, and control statements/options as input and outputs one load module. This file can 
be stored in a libary and then loaded for execution later. The linker does this process by combining
the input modules using the requirements given by the options and the control statements. 

How our linker works
Our linker requires a minimum of 4 parameters: 
    1. The relocation address
    2. The name of the output file
    3 and up. The names of the object files that need to be linked.
The program involves two passes. In pass 1, it loops through the provided object files one by one and 
gathers and categorizes the M, T, D, H and E records and stores them in separate symbol tables. In pass 2, 
the H record is taken from the symbol table and written to the new file. Then the following M, T, and D
records are added, ending with the E records.
