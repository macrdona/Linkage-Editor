About the Linking Loader
A Linking Loader is defined as a computer system program that combines the conceptually separate processes 
of linking and loading. In linking, the program and other libraries that it makes use of must be brought
together and in loading, the linked program must be moved to memory and have addresses assigned to the data.
The linking loader is most commonly used in machines like SIC/XE because the presence of relative addressing
renders relocation unnecessary for most instructions. The linking loader takes a set of object files as input.

How our linker works
Our linking loader requires a minimum of 4 parameters: 
    1. The relocation address
    2. The name of the output file
    3 and up. The names of the object files that need to be linked.
The program involves two passes. In pass 1, it loops through the provided object files one by one and 
gathers and categorizes the M, T, D, H and E records, stores them, and assigns addresses to the external symbols. 
In pass 2, the actual linking and loading is done. We make use of multiple symbol tables, to store the external 
symbols as well as the records. We also maintain two big variables: the program load address and the control
section address. The first of this (program load address) contains the starting address in memory where the 
linked program is supposed to be loaded. The second (control section address) contains the starting address that
is assigned to the control section.
